# React TypeScript CRUD Application

## Task Overview

This project involves developing a web application using TypeScript, React, and Material-UI. The application fetches data from a public API, displays it in a table format, and allows users to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on the displayed data.

## Application Structure

The application is composed of three main components:

1. **Home Component**: The main component that fetches data from the API, manages state, and renders other components.
2. **CreateData Component**: A modal form for creating and editing employee data.
3. **DataTable Component**: A table to display employee data with options to edit and delete entries.

## Deployment Link

The application is deployed and accessible at [Netlify](https://crud-react-ts.netlify.app/).
